          <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2> <br>
		  
			  <h3>Burden on Player:</h3> <br>
			  
				<p>Generally few issues were found in this criteria, although one expert noted that the player was sometimes hindered by problems with the interface, citing the crosshair getting stuck on terrain as an example.</p> <br>

			  <h3>Feedback for Player:</h3> <br> 
				<p>Several experts noted that the feedback in combat was not very satisfying as the audio and visual effects were limited. One expert also pointed out that the player’s charge bar was ambiguous as to what it was showing and that they were unsure what it was or why it was changing.</p> <br>

			  <h3>Help and Documentation:</h3> <br> 
				<p>All three experts raised concerns over the game’s tutorial system (signposts on the ground that the player can walk up to and read). It was noted that there was nothing forcing the player to read the signs or anything to stop them from walking past without reading them at all, which could easily lead to the player skipping the tutorial without meaning to. This was reinforced by one of the experts not realising that the signposts were interactive and simply ignoring them. Additionally, it was a point of concern that the tutorial, even when read, did not explain that reflecting projectiles charged the player’s weapon, which is a core mechanic in the game.</p> <br>

			  <h3>Status and Score:</h3> <br>
				<p>The lack of progress indication was a common issue, as the game does not provide any form of objective or direction indication. Despite this, one expert found the NPC characters throughout the level to be enough indication of direction. A larger concern raised was that enemies did not have a health bar to display their status, which could leave the player confused or frustrated in combat.</p> <br>


			  <h3>Gameplay and Story Integration:</h3> <br> 
				<p>The separation of the game’s story and gameplay was a large issue here. One expert noted that the NPC character who delivered the story was easily missed and there was nothing preventing the player from ignoring them while another pointed out that the gameplay is entirely independent of the story and that some form of interactivity between the villain the and the player in the gameplay could have helped to fix this.</p> <br>
				
				<p>However, one expert did portray the story in a positive light, saying that the ability to ignore the story meant it did not distract from the gameplay, and that the placement of the NPC throughout the level allowed the player to naturally follow the storyline as they progressed through the level.</p> <br>

			  <h3>Navigation:</h3> <br> 
				<p>The camera was the main point of concern regarding navigation with experts noting that the lack of camera acceleration/deceleration, as well as lack of an orientation reset function, left the navigation feeling rough and unpolished.</p> <br>
