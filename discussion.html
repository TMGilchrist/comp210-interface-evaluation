		  <h2>Recommendations</h2><br>
		    <p>After analysing the results of the two tests, it is clear that Demiurge has several key usability issues that could be greatly improved. Below are the recommended changes that could be made to the game to address some of the most critical problems and a short explanation of why they would improve the user's experience.</p></br>
		
          <h2>Add a controls menu: </h2>
		  
			<p>Confusion over core mechanics and the controls needed to use them was a common problem in both tests, showing that the game’s tutorial was not sufficient. Although improving the tutorial would be ideal, the easiest method to ensure the user can always understand the controls – not just at the start of the game – would be to allow the player to check the controls from a game menu.</p><br>
		  
		  <h2>Add more visual feedback to combat:</h2>
			<p>The lack of variety in the visual feedback during combat was noted by one of the experts and the visual clarity of the game received fairly low scores. It is important for a game focused on combat to make that combat both enjoyable and easy to understand and interact with. Useful visual feedback such as effects when the player or an enemy is damaged could help to make the combat more interesting and also feel more impactful. In addition to this, adding health bars to enemies is a simple addition that would greatly improve the player’s ability to understand combat situations and reduce frustration.</p><br>
			
		  <h2>Add a boss fight with the villain:</h2>
		  	<p>The story is completely separate from the gameplay and the player has absolutely no agency, which was a major issue identified by the experts. Adding a boss fight would be a fairly simple implementation – as the game already supports combat and AI enemies -  which would not only allow the player to directly interact with the main villain of the story, but would add a physical threat to the player, rather than threats that are purely narrative based.</p><br>
