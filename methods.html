          <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
		  <p>The first method will be a heuristic evaluation carried out by three experts, Adrian Carter, Sam Auber and Ryan Clarke, who will be evaluating the game on six criteria.</p>

		  <h3>Details</h3>
		  
		  <ul style="list-style-type-disc">
			<li>Burden on Player: How much time and effort the player needs to spend interacting with the interface. This can be an indicator of how intuitive the combat system is. </li>
			<li>Feedback for Player: If the game provides some form of feedback to the player, to aid in interaction and immersion.</li>
			<li>Help and Documentation: How well is the game's tutorial implemented and how effective is it in aiding the player learn the game.</li>
			<li>Status and Score: The ways in which the game provides the player with an indication of important information or progress.</li>
			<li>Gameplay and Story Integration: How well was the game's story tied to, and expressed through, the gameplay?</li>
			<li>Navigation</li>
		  </ul>
		  
		  <h3>Controls</h3>
			<p>None of the experts will have played the game until this point. Each expert will play the game for ten minutes before starting their evaluation, which will help ensure that all of them have a basic understanding of the game before beginning to evaluate. In addition to this, they will receive no outside tutorial or assistance with the game, meaning that their assessment of the intuitiveness of the combat system will not be altered due to prior knowledge of it.
			
			Each expert will be using the same computer and controller (a mouse and keyboard) to prevent any controller differences from changing their perceptions of the game's usability.
			</p>
		  
		  <h3>Recording</h3>
			<p>Each expert will note their findings in the provided evaluation document. It will not be mandatory to fill out all the sections of the document, only those where the expert identifies issues or feels it is important to note an observation.</p>
		  
		  <h3>Sample</h3>		  
			<p></p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2> Survey </h2>
		  <p>In addition to the evaluation, a survey will be given to to a group of users who have played the game. The survey will include ten questions using a 5-point score system that aim to examine the usability of the game, particularly the combat system.
	  
		  </p>
		  
		  <ol>
			<li>How intuitive were the game's controls?</li>
			<li>How clear were the game's objectives?</li>
			<li>How responsive did you find the character?</li>
			<li>How easy was it to aim </li>
			<li>How clear was the status of your character?</li>
			
			<li>How often did you use the shield to reflect projectiles?</li>
			<li>How engaged did you feel while playing the game?</li>
			<li>How visually clear was the game during combat?</li>
			<li>How you enjoyable did you find the combat?</li>
			<li>How likely would you be to recommend this game to a friend?</li>
		  </ol>
		  
		  <p> The scoring system will use a five-point scale - Not at All, Not Very, Unsure, Somewhat, Completely - to give the user enough options to encompass their thoughts but also allow quantitative data to be gathered easily.
		  
		  The participants will be given the game to play for ten minutes, without further instruction, before being given the survey to complete.</p>
