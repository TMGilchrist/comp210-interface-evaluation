          <h2>Heuristic Evaluation</h2>
		  <p>The first usability test performed was a heuristic evaluation carried out by three experts. The experts were given the game to play and a set of heuristics by which to assess the game.</p> <br>

		  <h3>Details</h3>
		  
		  The following heuristics were used in the evaluation: <br>
		  
		  <ul style="list-style-type-disc">
			<li>Burden on Player: How much time and effort the player needs to spend interacting with the interface. This can be an indicator of how intuitive the combat system is. </li>
			<li>Feedback for Player: If the game provides some form of feedback to the player, to aid in interaction and immersion.</li>
			<li>Help and Documentation: How well is the game's tutorial implemented and how effective is it in aiding the player learn the game.</li>
			<li>Status and Score: The ways in which the game provides the player with an indication of important information or progress.</li>
			<li>Gameplay and Story Integration: How well was the game's story tied to, and expressed through, the gameplay?</li>
			<li>Navigation</li>
		  </ul>
		  
		  <br>
		  
		  <h3>Controls</h3>
			<p>None of the experts had played the game until this point. Each expert was given the game to play for ten minutes before starting their evaluation, which helped to ensure that all of them had a basic understanding of the game before beginning to evaluate. In addition to this, they received no outside tutorial or assistance with the game, meaning that their assessment of the intuitiveness of the combat system was not altered due to prior knowledge of it.</p> <br>
			
			<p>Each expert used the same computer and controller (a mouse and keyboard) to prevent any controller differences from changing their perceptions of the game's usability. 
			</p> <br>
		  
		  <h3>Recording</h3>
			<p>Each expert noted their findings in the provided evaluation document. It was not mandatory to fill out all the sections of the document, only those where the expert identified issues or felt it was important to note an observation.</p> <br>
		  
		  <h3>Sample</h3>		  
			<p></p>

        </section>

        <section>
          <h2> Survey </h2>
			  <p>In addition to the evaluation, a survey was given to a group of users after they had played the game. The survey included ten questions using a 5-point score system that aimed to examine the usability of the game, particularly the combat system.</p> <br>
		  
		  <h3>Details</h3>
		  
			The survey contained the following questions. <br>
		  
			  <ol>
				<li>How intuitive were the game's controls?</li>
				<li>How clear were the game's objectives?</li>
				<li>How responsive did you find the character?</li>
				<li>How easy was it to aim </li>
				<li>How clear was the status of your character?</li>
				
				<li>How often did you use the shield to reflect projectiles?</li>
				<li>How engaged did you feel while playing the game?</li>
				<li>How visually clear was the game during combat?</li>
				<li>How you enjoyable did you find the combat?</li>
				<li>How likely would you be to recommend this game to a friend?</li>
			  </ol>
		  
		  <h3>Controls</h3>
			  <p>The participants were given the game to play for ten minutes, without further instruction, before being given the survey to complete.</p> <br>
				  
				  
		  <h3>Recording</h3>		  
			  <p>The scoring system of the survey used a five-point scale - Not at All, Not Very, Unsure, Somewhat, Completely - to give the user enough options to encompass their thoughts but also allow quantitative data to be gathered easily. </p> <br>
