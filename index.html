          <h2>Demiurge</h2>
			<p>Demiurge is a third-person bullet hell game, set in a science fiction world. The player must explore the planet they have crash-landed on, using their energy shield to reflect the projectiles of the planet’s inhabitants, while also returning fire with their chargeable weapon.</p> <br>
		  
			<p>One of the developers conducted a usability test to identify problems with the game’s combat system, using two methodologies and utilizing online surveys and evaluation forms to capture user responses.</p>

          <h2>Executive Summary</h2>
			<p>The developer conducted the test in two parts. First, three experts conducted an on-site heuristic evaluation in the studio, recording their findings in an evaluation document assessing the general usability of the game. </p> <br>
		  
			<p>After this test had been performed, a group of users were given the game to play at home. After a short period of playing the game alone, the users were then asked to complete a short online survey to examine their experience with the usability of the game. </p>
