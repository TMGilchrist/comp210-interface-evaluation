          <h2>Conclusion</h2> <br>
			<p>Overall, the easily-missed tutorial and poor clarity of core gameplay mechanics, as well as the large disconnect between story and gameplay were the main issues with Demiurge. Despite these problems, users had a generally positive response to the game, although many users were unsure if they actually found the game enjoyable, suggesting that the combined effect of the multiple usability problems reduced their enjoyment. Visual feedback was also clearly an area which could be improved and which may have contributed to the lack of enjoyment.</p> <br>
